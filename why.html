    <h1 style="color: white">Why This Website Is Important</h1>
    <p>When deciding what I was going to get my mother for her birthday, this website was the only acceptable thought.
      For those who know my mother, these answers will make sense. For those who know my mom, a birthday card would not
      be sufficent for her because as you know she keeps a tidy house. There is no clutter in sight and who would want my
      birthday card to waste away in a drawer. Therefore a website, including everything a card would hold and more was
      ideal. For those who know my mom, you know she loves her ipads. At any point in the day, my mom can walk over to
      one of her three ipads and quickly paste this url in to remind herself why she is loved. For those who know my
      mom, you know she'd appreciate this website because she loves to see her good tuition money being put to good use!
    </p>

    <p style="background-color: white; color:#DDA0DD; font-size: 25;">Anyways, you get the point. I hope this website
      serves my mom and all her friends and family a source of happiness. A place to remind themselves how special my
      mom is and how she deserves nothing but peace, love, and happiness! This will be a great place to look back on and
      hopefully add more memories as we continue life!
