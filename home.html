            <p>When deciding what I was going to get my mother for her birthday, this website was the only acceptable thought. For those who know my mother, these answers will make sense. For those who know my mom, a birthday card would not be sufficent for her because as you she keeps a tidy house. There is no clutter in sight and who would want my birthday card to waste away in a drawer. Therefor a website, including everything a card would hold and more was ideal. For those who know my mom, you know she loves her ipads. At any point in the day, my mom can walk over to one of her three ipads and quickly paste this url in to remind herself why she is loved. For those who know my mom, you know she'd appreciate this website because she loves to see her good tuition money being put to good use! </p>
            </p>
            <div class="header2">
                <p style="background-color: white; color:#DDA0DD; font-size: 25;">Anyways, you get the point. I hope this website serves my mom and all her friends and family a source of happiness. A place to remind themselves how special my mom is and how she deserves nothing but peace, love, and happiness! This will be a great place to look back on and hopefully add more memories as we continue life!
